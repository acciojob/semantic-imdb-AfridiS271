		<p>Baahubali-The Beginning (2015) is essentially about a tribal
	    warrior boy, Shivudu who learns his past and awaits his destiny.
	    The story is set in and around the fictional kingdom of Mahishmati.
	    On the backdrop of a mighty water fall, an old yet regal lady (Sivagami)
	    tries desperately to save a baby from a few attacking soldiers, but dies 
		in the process. A tribal chief and his wife adopt that baby boy as their 
		son. Egged on by curiosity and courage, the boy (Shivudu) makes a daring 
		journey against the wishes of his mother, leaving the valley, towards the
		 waterfall and further north into the nearby mountains. He is simply smitten
		 by a rebel (Avantika) whose cause he willingly he takes up. This is the cause
		 that brings him to Mahishmati Kingdom, and makes him confront his legacy.
		 He saves the trapped and enslaved queen, later revealed to be his true 
		 mother (Devasena). He learns about his father, the benevolent and 
		 righteous (Amarendra Baahubali), and his ambitious uncle (Bhallaladeva) as told
		  by a loyal warrior slave (Kattappa). And what is the stunning answer Kattappa gives for Shivudu's questi
		on as to who killed his father, Amarendra Baahubali? </p>
